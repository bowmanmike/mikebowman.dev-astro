Quick announcement! As of today, my personal site and this blog are both
HTTPS-enabled! Secure web traffic for everyone!

It didn't take too long to set up, and was pretty straightforward. This site is
hosted on a $5 Digital Ocean droplet, which is a super-simple and affordable
hosting system. I followed
[this](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-16-04)
guide. The Digital Ocean tutorials are generally great, even if you're not using
DO for your hosting.

Anyways, I don't really have anything else to say, I was just excited that
everything worked!
