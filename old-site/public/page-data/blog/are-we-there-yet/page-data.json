        "html": "<p>Are we there yet?</p>\n<p>When I was a kid, my siblings and I needed to find ways to entertain ourselves on\nlong car rides. We thought it was fun to \"secretly plan\" to ask my parents, in\nunison, and in that particular sing-song way, \"Are we there yet?\". Of course, we\nrarely were, and we knew that. And sure enough, the answer was always no. (More\nspecifically, the answer was usually an interval of time measured in episodes of\nBill Nye, the Science Guy, which somehow became the standard unit of measurement\nfor long car rides in our family.) <!-- endexcerpt --></p>\n<p>But what, you might ask, does that anecdote have to do with programming, web\ndevelopment, freelance work, or literally anything else you might expect me to\nwrite about here?</p>\n<p>The truth is, when I left my job to start down this whole freelance path, I had\na vague sense of how long things might take. I didn't set myself any real hard\ndeadlines, and I made sure that I was financially set up to be patient. But as\nwith anything, <em>the best laid schemes o’ mice an’ men. Gang aft a-gley</em>. Errm.\nNot quite sure what that last bit means. But the gist is clear. No matter how\nwell you think you've planned, something will go wrong.</p>\n<p>Not that anything has gone particularly <em>wrong</em> with my experience so far. I've\nactually been able to make more connections than I expected I'd be able to,\nwithout going down paths like cold-emailing businesses or being able to go to\nnetworking events in-person. I think, if you were to have asked me back in\nNovember how long it would take me to get my first gig, my answer would've been\nprobably \"A month or so of looking hard\". Well, it's pretty much the end of\nFebruary and we aren't quite there yet.</p>\n<p>Not to say I haven't been busy, or that I'm not optimistic. I've had lots of\nproductive, interesting conversations. I have a hunch that some of those\nconversations may result in some work, even if they've gone dormant for the time\nbeing. I'm allowing (forcing?) myself to be patient, and waiting for something\nthat makes sense. I'm also trying to spend some of my days improving my skills,\nfilling in gaps in my knowledge and experience that I've identified as\npriorities.</p>\n<p>The truth is, I've been getting a bit bored lately. A bit antsy. I had kinda\nfigured that by now, I'd be working. It's ok that I'm not, but it's also ok that\nI wish that I were. This whole experience so far has been a bit of a roller-coaster,\nbut the important thing is, that's ok. I'm in this for the long haul. I don't\nwant to just try freelancing to say that I've done it. I want to see if this is\na sustainable lifestyle for me long-term. That's a big part of why I'm not\nrushing into anything. It's why I'm being patient. It's why, ultimately, I'm ok\nwith being a bit bored right now. Learning to be comfortable with that boredom\nand uncertainty is something that's going to take some getting used to.\nRealistically though, if freelancing is something I want to do long-term, those\nare feelings that I'm going to need to get used to.</p>\n<p>So where does that leave us. I've had to adjust a few expectations that I'd had\nfor myself. One of the big things I'm trying to let go of is the idea that every\nday has to be filled with ~8ish hours of \"work\". What does that even mean\nanymore? Basically, nothing. I try to keep a routine, but I don't let myself\nfeel bad if, on a given day (or days), I don't have it in me to buckle down and\nwork. If I have a day where I'm not super productive, that's ok. The important\nthing is that I build this sustainably. I don't want to push myself to the point\nof burnout, or where I start to resent the routine.</p>\n<p>This post has turned a little bit rambly, but I hope at least one of you might\nbe able to take something useful from it. As always, keep well, and don't\nhesitate to reach out if anything resonates with you in particular!</p>"
