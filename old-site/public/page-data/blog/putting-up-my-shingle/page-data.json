Lots of updates, lots of changes, lots of big new\nexciting things to talk about. So grab a beverage of your choice, settle in, and\nlets get down to it. <!-- endexcerpt --></p>\n<p><strong>SELF MARKETING AHEAD</strong>  If you or anyone you know is in need of some web\ndevelopment, please don't hesitate to reach out! I'm looking for work,\n#OpenForBusiness, as LinkedIn would put it. You can find me at\n<a href=\"mailto:mike@mikebowman.dev\">mike@mikebowman.dev</a>  <strong>END SELF MARKETING</strong></p>\n<p>Ok, with that out of the way, lets talk about the biggest and most obvious\nchange, this website. I'll have a post in the next little while telling a bit of\nthe story of how I built this new site, and what inspired me to make the change.\nFor now, suffice it to say that this is a fully hand-built custom site. I used\n<a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/\">Gatsby</a> and <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">TailwindCSS</a>,\nand I'm really happy with how it's turned out. It's open source, so you can take\na look at it on <a href=\"https://github.com/bowmanmike/mikebowman.dev\">Github</a> if that's\nyour bag. But, like I said. More on that another time.</p>\n<p>The main reason I wanted to sit down to write today was to talk about my\nevolving career path. About 6 weeks ago, I left the corporate world. I'd been\nworking at <a href=\"https://pagerduty.com\">PagerDuty</a> for about 8 months, but I decided\nthat I wanted to strike out on my own. Blaze my own trail. Be my own boss. Put\nup my shingle, as my good friend Nick described it. So I did it. I left. It was\nhard, scary, exciting, nerve-wracking, and liberating, all at the same time. No\nlonger did I have to get out of bed at a certain time. No longer did I have\nregularly scheduled meetings, or work projects I was expected to help out on. No\nlonger, most importantly, did I have a steady paycheque finding it's way into my\naccount like clockwork on the 15th and the 30th. That was freaky.</p>\n<p>In spite of the freakyness of it all, the most appropriate word I'd use to\ndescribe my current situation is <em>liberating</em>. I am officially now responsible\nfor every aspect of my career. The lack of structure is a bit unnerving, but\nultimately I'm excited about the possibilities. For me, right now, it feels like\nthe possibilities are endless.</p>\n<p>So how have I spent the past 6 weeks? However I've wanted! I've had a few\npersonal projects I've spent some time on (this website included!), I've been\nlearning more React and Front-End development (thank you to <a href=\"https://wesbos.com\">Wes\nBos</a> for the sweet resources and courses), I've started\nsearching for contract/freelance work on LinkedIn, HackerNews, and places like\nUpwork, and I've been working part-time as a Web Development Mentor at\n<a href=\"https://lighthouselabs.ca\">Lighthouse Labs</a> but mostly, I've been feeling\ncomfortable and balanced. I'm free to pursue what interests me, what excites me,\nand what motivates me. That, in itself, is the most valuable thing I think i've\ngained in the past several weeks. I'm excited by the possibilities, and looking\nforward to seeing what's out there.</p>\n<p>So, more concretely, what are the next steps? As I mentioned, I've been working\npart-time as a mentor, which is a pretty cool position to be in. Ever since I\nfinished my own boot camp, almost 6 years ago now (holy smokes where does the\ntime go???), I've thought it'd be cool to work at a boot camp. I've always liked\nteaching and helping others learn, and in this job I feel like I'm giving\nsomething back to the tech world that has given me so much these past years.\nIt's fun to see students progress, it's rewarding to watch as they grasp\nconcepts that are completely new to them, and it's cool to see the potential in\nthem as they learn.</p>\n<p>On the work front, things are a bit different. I've started looking for\nfreelance or contract work, which is something totally new to me. I've never\ndone this kind of thing before, and to be frank, self-marketing is not something\nI've ever considered a strength of mine. But it's an important skill, and it's\nsomething that I want to improve on, so the grind begins. It's a slow process,\nbut I'm absolutely certain that it's what I want to be doing, and I'm confident\nthat it will work out for me.</p>\n<p>Well, this whole writing thing feels a bit odd. I think I'm rusty. Hopefully,\nreader, you'll excuse my somewhat scatterbrained musings, but I think it's\nimportant for me to try to get back into the swing of writing a bit more\nregularly. I hope you find some interest or value in it, but I thank you with\nall my heart for making it this far anyways. If all goes to plan, my next update\nwill come more quickly than this one did. On that note, I'll sign off. Until\nnext time!</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"putting-up-my-shingle","prevPost":{"slug":"json-fun-for-everyone","title":"JSON: Fun for Everyone!"},"nextPost":{"slug":"websites-arent-built-in-a-day","title":"Websites Aren't Built In A Day"},"title":"Putting Up My Shingle"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2310292891","63159454"]}
