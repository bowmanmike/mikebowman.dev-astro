        "html": "<p>Alright. Let's see if I can remember how to write. It's been a few weeks since\nI've typed anything that's not code, so I might be a bit rusty. Apologies in\nadvance, to those it may offend. Things are winding down here at Bitmaker. Well,\nthey are for me and my cohort, the affectionately-titled <em>TEAM GORT</em>. We had our\nlast day of class on the 11th of March, and we presented our final projects to\nthe world at large (or part of it, anyways.) So now we're set loose on the world\nas mostly-fully-formed junior developers. Maybe not the most glamourous title,\nbut you gotta start somewhere.</p>\n<p>So lets talk about final projects. Mine, as I may have mentioned, was called\n<em>chortal</em>. Our original, working title was <em>Rmmts</em>, which as a team we became\nquite attached to, but, as much as we liked it, it's a pretty terrible name for\na product. So we landed on <em>chortal</em>. It's kinda like a mix between chore and\nportal, and it also sounds like a pokemon, so it's got some serious weight\nbehind it. For those not in the know, it's an online platform for roommates to\nkeep track of household goings-on. Chores, money, messaging, announcements, all\nthat kinda fun stuff. It can send email or SMS notifications to remind you to\ntake out the garbage every Wednesday, or to pay your rent once a month. You can\ncheck it out <a href=\"http://chortal.herokuapp.com\">here</a>, and if you're feeling like\nbeing a bit of a beta tester/guinea pig, sign up and actually use the app. It\nworks, and you can for sure actually use it. It's mostly functional. I'm sure\nit's full of bugs we haven't found yet, but the general features all seem to\nwork.</p>\n<p>I worked with two people from my class, <a href=\"http://karenjho.com/\">Karen</a> and\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/patrickcruiks\">Patrick</a>. We spent basically all our free\ntime in the last 3ish weeks on the project, and I think it shows. I'm really\npleased with how it all turned out, and how we all managed to work together. We\ndidn't have any giant merge conflicts, and every new feature we added seemed to\nnot break all the previous ones, which was often surprising. We had a lot of fun\non the project, and I think it'd be fun to see it actually be used by real\npeople. We haven't really had any conversations around working further on the\nproject, but it would be a shame to just put it away and never look at it again,\nso we'll see what happens on that front.</p>\n<p>This brings us to Tuesday night, the \"Meet Your Makers\" (get it?! because\nbitMAKER). We were kinda guinea pigs in this situation, but I think things\nworked out extremely well for everyone. Typically, the final project demo night\nfor each Bitmaker cohort has been a series of 15-minute presentations to a room\nfull of people. For our cohort, they decided to switch it to more of a\nscience-fair (though they insisted it was called a \"Symposium\") style. Each\ngroup had a giant iMac on a table around the edge of the room where they set up\na little station. Demo the app, have your own laptop handy in case people want\nto dig a little deeper into the code, have a stack of resumes and contact info\non hand, and hope people want to talk to you. I printed 15 resumes, and had a\nbunch of my spiffy new business cards. I ended up giving out all my resumes, and\nmost of my cards as well too, so I guess it was a success.</p>\n<p>No, it was definitely a success. Over the next 2 hours, people from various tech\ncompanies in the city, some looking to hire, some not, circulated around the\nroom and chatted with everyone about their projects. It was tiring, but a great\nchance for us to make contacts in the industry, and hopefully get a few\ninterviews set up. As I said, I gave out tons of resumes and cards, and managed\nto snag a few cards myself. So now it's kinda up to me to touch base with these\nfolks and see what they're all about. Except for the fact that its \"Hiring Week\"\nright now.</p>\n<p>Hiring week? Sounds great, right? Yeah, it's pretty cool. Maaaaaaaybe a bit\noptimistically-titled (I don't expect to get hired this week), but it gets the\npoint across. Bitmaker has a pretty solid reputation in the tech scene here in\nToronto. So they use those connections to try and put us fledgling devs in\ncontact with companies looking to hire people for junior-ish roles. They get in\ncontact with Bitmaker, and Bitmaker tries to match us students up with companies\nthat they think would be a good fit. As I write this, I'm waiting at Bitmaker\nfor my first interview, and I've got two more set up after this, one this\nafternoon and one next week. Hopefully I'll be able to snag a few more before\nthe week's out. They're generally short, 15 or 30 minute chats, but it's a good\nscreening process for the companies. They get a sense of who we are, and they\nget to decide if they want to pursue the interview process with us any further.</p>\n<p>As I've learned recently, tech interviewing is a pretty serious process. It'll\ngenerally start with a short \"screener\" interview, to see if you're a reasonable\nperson who can interact with other reasonable people. Then there'll usually be a\ntechnical portion, where you'll be given a code challenge to either take home\nand submit later, or work out on a whiteboard in front of some technical people\nfrom the company. Some places will do another round of interviews afterwards,\nand then finally decide whether or not they want to make a move. It's a pretty\nintimidating process, especially for someone who's only really been coding for\n10 weeks. It's great that Bitmaker puts this effort in for us, so that we get a\nbit of low-stakes interview practice, and we can get our names out there in the\nworld.</p>\n<p>I recognize that this post is getting pretty long, but bear with me! I'm into\nthe final section: What the hell am I gonna do with all my free time now?</p>\n<p>I've got a few things in mind. Hiring week is gonna take some energy, and really\nit's just the beginning of the job hunt. Bitmaker's gonna get me started, but\nI've really gotta be on it for myself. Luckily, it seems like there's no\nshortage of developer jobs to be had in the city, and thats before you even\ncount the possibility of freelance work, which can be quite lucrative, but a\ntotally different kind of challenge. So I'll be getting on that grind, which I'm\nweirdly excited for.</p>\n<p>It's also a pretty big change, to go from being forced to code for 8+ hours a\nday, to having nothing on the go. It's definitely easy to get rusty, so I've\ngotta find a way to keep my skills sharp. I've got a few little projects in mind\nto keep myself busy and keep my skills sharp. There's a whole ton of new\ntechnologies I want to explore a bit, and now's definitely the time. It'd be\ngood to be able to say to employers that I've got experience with Foundation, or\nBackboneJS, or React, so I'll try and learn a bit about them in the next little\nwhile, while the job hunt continues.</p>\n<p>And that leaves one question. What, dear reader, will become of this blog? It\nbegan as an attempt to chronicle my time here at Bitmaker. And it worked really\nwell when there was tons of new material coming at me every day. Things should\nslow down a bit now, so it seems likely that the posts will slow down a bit. I\nmight start to shift things towards a more general blog, or maybe towards the\ntechnical side. It might be cool to write a short post now and again about a new\ntechnology I'm exploring, or something cool I've been working on at my\n(currently hypothetical) new job. Or maybe a post about the pitfalls of the\nToronto rental housing market. Or maybe about the Leafs. Who knows. I think\nthat'll sort itself out on its own.</p>\n<p>And with that, I'll sign off. Enjoy the long weekend, and may the force be with\nyou. Always.</p>"
