Secure web traffic for everyone!</p>\n<p>It didn't take too long to set up, and was pretty straightforward. This site is\nhosted on a $5 Digital Ocean droplet, which is a super-simple and affordable\nhosting system. I followed\n<a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-16-04\">this</a>\nguide. The Digital Ocean tutorials are generally great, even if you're not using\nDO for your hosting.</p>\n<p>Anyways, I don't really have anything else to say, I was just excited that\neverything worked!</p>"
