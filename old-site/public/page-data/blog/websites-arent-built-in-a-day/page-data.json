Medium is a popular\nwriting platform among tech types, and it worked for me for a while. However,\npretty soon I got an itch. An itch to do something a little more challenging.\nSomething a little more fancy, a little more tech-y. I wanted to boost my tech\nstreet-cred, more or less. I figured that the best way to get that done would be\nto build my own site, and host it on my very own domain name. So I went off and\nbought <a href=\"https://bowmanmike.com\">bowmanmike.com</a>. My first choice,\n<em>mikebowman.com</em>, was (and still is) owned by a real-estate agent from Dallas,\nso that one was a no-go. But <a href=\"https://bowmanmike.com\">bowmanmike.com</a> seemed\nlike a solid option.</p>\n<p>So there I was, shiny new domain name in hand. I got to thinking, how does one\nbuild a blog? At some point during the bootcamp, we were introduced to\n<a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com\">Jekyll</a>. It fit the bill perfectly. I was able to write\nmy blog posts using <a href=\"https://www.markdownguide.org/\">Markdown</a>, which I liked.\nIt was simple to set up, had lots of pre-made themes available, and was\nreasonably customizable. I got it wired up to my own domain name, and off I\nwent. This was a solid solution, if somewhat visually unremarkable. It isn't\nlive on the internet anywhere at the moment, but it looked like this.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 650px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/850f833b695e046e6a1f9d998f0c8fca/84a78/jekyll-site.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 83.43558282208589%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Jekyll Site\"\n        title=\"Jekyll Site\"\n        src=\"/static/850f833b695e046e6a1f9d998f0c8fca/a6d36/jekyll-site.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/850f833b695e046e6a1f9d998f0c8fca/222b7/jekyll-site.png 163w,\n/static/850f833b695e046e6a1f9d998f0c8fca/ff46a/jekyll-site.png 325w,\n/static/850f833b695e046e6a1f9d998f0c8fca/a6d36/jekyll-site.png 650w,\n/static/850f833b695e046e6a1f9d998f0c8fca/e548f/jekyll-site.png 975w,\n/static/850f833b695e046e6a1f9d998f0c8fca/3c492/jekyll-site.png 1300w,\n/static/850f833b695e046e6a1f9d998f0c8fca/84a78/jekyll-site.png 1832w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Plain, simple, functional.</p>\n<p>But kinda boring, and not really very technically interesting.</p>\n<p>As you can see from the post history here, the blog kinda withered on the vine\nfor a few years. I didn't post at all between 2018 and 2020. I didn't really\nhave the time or energy to write, and I probably also thought that I didn't have\nanything worth writing about. Not sure if that was actually true, but whatever\nthe reasoning, I went for several years without writing any posts.</p>\n<p>But! I still wanted to exist on the web. I still had my domain name, so I\nfigured I should at least put up a simple page with some contact info and\nwhatnot. I never got very far down the road of building this particular site,\nbut it did exist for a while, and it looked like this.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 650px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/dd80006b69bbae6b87d337624ae24b17/84a78/raw-html-site.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 83.43558282208589%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Raw HTML Site\"\n        title=\"Raw HTML Site\"\n        src=\"/static/dd80006b69bbae6b87d337624ae24b17/a6d36/raw-html-site.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/dd80006b69bbae6b87d337624ae24b17/222b7/raw-html-site.png 163w,\n/static/dd80006b69bbae6b87d337624ae24b17/ff46a/raw-html-site.png 325w,\n/static/dd80006b69bbae6b87d337624ae24b17/a6d36/raw-html-site.png 650w,\n/static/dd80006b69bbae6b87d337624ae24b17/e548f/raw-html-site.png 975w,\n/static/dd80006b69bbae6b87d337624ae24b17/3c492/raw-html-site.png 1300w,\n/static/dd80006b69bbae6b87d337624ae24b17/84a78/raw-html-site.png 1832w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Very plain, but at least if somebody were to visit\n<a href=\"https://bowmanmike.com\">bowmanmike.com</a>, there'd be something there.</p>\n<p>This brings us to today. Obviously, you're looking at my new site, so there's\nnot much to add here. I'm really happy with the design. It's not a template,\nit's an original design that I worked out with some assistance from some people\nwith better eyes for design than I have. But ultimately, it's my own. I can say\nI built it from scratch. I know the ins and outs, I know how it works. I know\nwhere all the styles are coming from, and there's no template magic hidden\nbehind the scenes. I'm thrilled with the result, and I hope you like it too!</p>\n<p>This brings us to the technical portion. Like I said, if this isn't your thing,\nfeel free to stop reading, and maybe click on one of the other pages I've got\nhere! For those brave enough, lets forge ahead!</p>\n<p>This site is generated using <a href=\"https://gatsbyjs.com\">Gatsby</a>. Gatsby, in many\nways, is a spiritual successor to Static Site Generators like\n<a href=\"https://jeklyyrg.com\">Jekyll</a> or <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/\">Hugo</a>. Those tools allow\nyou to generate a full site ahead of time, and just render out raw HTML (and\nsome Javacsript, if you want). This means all you need to host it a static site,\nwhich has a bunch of benefits when it comes to things like simplicity of\nhosting, deployment, SEO, speed, accessibility... all that good stuff. Browsers\nare <em>really</em> good at optimising HTML, and servers and hosting platforms are also\n<em>really</em> good at optimising their delivery.</p>\n<p>However, they can be a bit limited in their functionality. As soon as you need\nto do things like dynamically load data, they lose a lot of their benefits.\nFor example, if you're loading your blog posts from a headless CMS or something\nsimilar, you'll need to query all that data at runtime, which takes a non-zero\namount of time. There isn't really an easy way around it. This is where Gatsby\n(and other, more modern, Static Site Generators) shine.</p>\n<p>Gatsby does a lot more work for you at build time. Gatsby has the concept of\n\"sources\", which are adapters to various data sources. This blog, for example,\nexists as a collection of markdown files. In order to do some magic like\npagination, or showing a preview of the most recent post on the home page,\nthey're imported into Gatsby through a markdown transformer, called\n<a href=\"https://remark.js.org/\">Remark</a>. This brings us to the key to Gatsby's ability\nto dynamically generate a site: it's GraphQL API.</p>\n<p>Gatsby lets you build your static site using React, and it uses GraphQL at\nbuild-time to dynamically generate various pages and pieces of data. When the\nsite builds, Gatsby spins up an GraphQL API. In your React components (and a few\nother places, but that's not really important right now), you can define queries\nthat run <em>at build time</em> against that API. This lets you, for example,\ndynamically load your blog posts to build an index page with pagination, or a\npreview component. These pages are then rendered to static HTML and served to\nthe client just like Jekyll.</p>\n<p>Gatsby does sprinkle in some Javascript on the client-side to optimize a few\nthings, such as page navigation and image loading, but the key point here is\nthat the site works <em>perfectly well</em> without Javascript. At it's core, it's a\nsimple HTML and CSS page that the browser renders. No magic, no dynamically\nloading data, just a quick, snappy, browser-native page.</p>\n<p>Speaking of CSS, since Gatsby is a React app at build-time, you can use whatever\nCSS strategy you like. Inline CSS, CSS Modules, Styled Components, PostCSS,\neverything you'd expect to see in a modern React app is available. Personally, I\nlike <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com\">TailwindCSS</a>, but you may have other opinions on\nthe matter. Fortunately, Gatsby does not care a lick about how you want to do\nyour CSS, so style those components to your heart's content, friendo.</p>\n<p>This is far from a full overview of what Gatsby is capable of, but here's a few\nother things it can take care of for you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Typescript! Yes, you can build your Gatsby app in Typescript. I haven't used\nit here, but moving over to TS is on my to-do list!</li>\n<li>Accessibility! Gatsby comes with some nice Accessibility features built in,\nlike adding ARIA attributes to your navigation link, progressively loading and\nscaling images for those on slower connections, and more!</li>\n<li>Progressive Web Apps and offline access</li>\n<li>A rich ecosystem of plugins that can help with the difficult or boring parts\nof web development.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While there's lots more of Gatsby you can investigate, this is a quick rundown\nof how it works, and how I'm using it. I hope you found something useful in\nhere! There's some links below that may provide more context for some of the\ntech discussed in this post.</p>\n<p>Until next time, cheers!</p>\n<h4 id=\"links\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#links\" aria-label=\"links permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Links</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://gatsbyjs.com\">GatsbyJS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com\">TailwindCSS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://reactjs.com\">React</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://graphql.org/\">GraphQL</a></li>\n</ul>"
